Files in this folder are automatically generated by oml2-scaffold from the definition file: click_mon-omldef.rb. Though, they are not directly used to build the Click monitor. Instead, these are to be used as reference when writing the actual monitor code in the upper directory. Note particularly the MP struct defs and the MP injection code.

Steps:

1. > oml2-scaffold --make --main click_mon-omldef.rb

    - Creates click_mon.c (main file),config.h and Makefile

2. > oml2-scaffold --oml click_mon-omldef.rb
    - Creates click_mon_oml.h file which contains the mp definition, and helper functions to add MPs and to inject.

3. > cp config.h ../
    - has version def generated from the omldef.rb
