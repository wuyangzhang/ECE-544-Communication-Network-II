Basic router configurations:
---------------------------

MF_BasicRouter.click
    - single interface: 'core'
    - GSTAR control plane
    - 'storage' enabled in data plane
    - No GNRS resolution, only flat GUID-based forwarding

MF_MultiRouter.click
    - single interface: 'core'
    - supports GNRS lookups for packets with no NA

MF_MultiRouter.click
    - single interface: 'core'
    - supports GNRS lookups
    - adds multi-delivery services to MFR:
        - anycast, multi-homing, multicast...

MF_AccessMultiRouter.click
    - builds on MultiRouter to support host access
	- core, edge interfaces for client access 
	- handles client association.
	- assumes client speaks MF at L3

MF_IPAccessMultiRouter.click
    - builds on MultiRouter to support host access over IPv4 links
	- same as access rtr above, along with ...
	- supports client to access rtr IP tunnel (fragmented MF L3 chunks encap in IPv4 packets)
	    - uses IP proto = 5 to designate MF over IPv4
	    - encaps/decaps IPv4 headers for hosts connecting over edge iface

Test configurations:
----------------------
test/MF_FileSender.click
	- generates data chunks of given size from specified local file 
        - can specify packet size that chunks are fragmented to at L2
        - delays secs before transmision begins

test/MF_FileReceiver.click
	- receives and writes chunks to file on local disk
        - random generation of file names

test/MF_ChunkSender.click
        - generates and transmits N dummy chunks of given size
	- support for inter-chunk spacing (msec)
        - can specify packet size that chunks are fragmented to at L2
        - delays secs before transmision begins

test/MF_ChunkReceiver.click
	- receives, logs(w/ timestamps) and consumes chunks

test/MF_FileSenderIPAccessMultiRouter.click
	- same as sender above with additional access functions
	- supports 2 interfaces (core and edge) 
	- IP-encap/decap MF pkts at the edge link
    - any number of hosts/clients can attach to edge interface

test/GNRS_InterfaceTest.click
    - generates internal insert/lookup requests to MF_ReqRespHandler
    - MF_ReqRespHandler will in turn interact with configured GNRS server
    - delay between requests and server/client endpoints can be configured
